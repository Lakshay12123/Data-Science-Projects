# 🏡 Housing Price Prediction Model (Supervised Learning)

This project is a part of my Data Science portfolio. It demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict house prices based on various features using supervised learning and regularized regression.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to predict the price of houses using features like:
- Area
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Year built
- Location details
- ...and more

This includes:
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Polynomial Ridge Regression
- Model evaluation (RMSE, Train-Test split)

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Model Summary

I used **Polynomial Ridge Regression** to handle non-linearity and reduce overfitting. Regularization (`alpha` tuning) helps balance bias-variance tradeoff.

### 🔍 Evaluation Metrics:
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- Visual inspection of prediction vs actual prices
- Ridge penalty tuning using alpha values

🎯 Future Improvements

- Add cross-validation for better robustness
- Try advanced models like Random Forest, XGBoost
- Deploy with Streamlit for user interaction
