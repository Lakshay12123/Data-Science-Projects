# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System

A machine learning project that predicts the most suitable crop to cultivate based on environmental and soil conditions like Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Build an ML model that can recommend the best crop based on soil and climate features.
- Evaluate and compare different classification models.
- Tune hyperparameters and create a reusable ML pipeline.
- Save and export the best model for deployment.

## 🧠 Models Trained

| Model               | Preprocessing         | Remarks                           |
|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Logistic Regression | StandardScaler        | Baseline performance              |
| Decision Tree       | Raw features          | Simple, interpretable             |
| Random Forest       | Raw features          | Better performance, robust        |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | StandardScaler        | Tuned using GridSearchCV          |

✅ **Best model**: K-Nearest Neighbors with `n_neighbors=5` and `weights='uniform'`

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

---

## ⚙️ Pipeline & Export

- Built a complete ML pipeline using `make_pipeline`.
- Saved model with `joblib` for future predictions:
  ```python
  joblib.dump(pipeline, 'crop_recommendation_model.pkl')


## 📌 Future Work
- Add web UI with Flask or Streamlit for real-time crop prediction.
- Include geographic location (latitude/longitude) in recommendation logic.
- Deploy the model as an API.
