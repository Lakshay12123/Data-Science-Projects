# 🫀 Heart Attack Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses supervised machine learning to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on a patient's health data. The goal is to build a reliable and interpretable model that can assist in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `heart_attack.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file).

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used contains patient information such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Serum cholesterol
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting ECG results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression
- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- Thalassemia
- Target (0: No heart disease, 1: Heart disease)

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow

The notebook includes the following steps:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection
- Model training using multiple classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## 🧠 Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## 💡 Key Insights

- Feature importance analysis revealed strong predictors of heart attack risk.
- Ensemble methods like Random Forest performed the best in terms of accuracy and robustness.


## 📌 Future Improvements
- Deploy the best model using a Flask or Streamlit web app
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Add SHAP or LIME for interpretability
